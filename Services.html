         <h2>Non destructive testing</h2>
        <p>NIS will perform non destructive testing on new and in-service equipment.</p>
        <h2>Magnetic Particle Inspection</h2>
        <p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) on your ferrous equipment, its components and welds to ensure it is suitable for continued service. MPI is an inspection method that produces magnetic fields in the component and magnetic particles in a wet or dry solution are then applied to the surface of the part being tested. The particles will be drawn to any stray magnetic fields from discontinuities and can be recorded and evaluated. 

MPI is able to detect discontinuities that are open to the surface and slightly sub-surface (near the surface) and is performed in accordance with SANS, ASME, BS, ISO and various other standards and our personnel are qualified in accordance with PCN and ASME.

 

The advantage of inspecting parts using MPI is the inexpensive cost and ease of application. MPI can usually be performed while equipment is in service (no shut down of your plant)

The disadvantage is the fact that it can only be used on equipment fabricated from ferrous metals and ferrous alloys in order to create a magnetic field in the part and it requires an electricity supply when using electromagnets. (permanent magnets are available as an alternative when no electrical supply is available)</p>
<h2>Dye Penetrant Inspection</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform Dye Penetrant Inspection (DPI) on your equipment, its components and welds to ensure it is suitable for continued service. DPI is an inspection method that is widely applied to all non-ferrous and ferrous materials  during new fabrication or in-service inspections. DPI is generally used to detect open to surface defects such as surface porosity and hairline cracks on castings, forgings and welding.

DPI uses a dye that will penetrate into discontinuities that are open to the surface. A white powder is used to draw the dye out of the discontinuities, making them visible to visual inspection methods. DPI is performed by NIS in accordance with SANS, ASME, BS, ISO and various other standards and our personnel are qualified in accordance with PCN and ASME.

 

The advantage of DPI is in the simplicity of the test and the relatively low cost at which it can be performed. DPI can usually be performed while equipment is in service (no shut down of your plant)

The disadvantage of DPI is the fact that it will detect only the discontinuities that are open to the surface and the requirement for a smooth surface where excessive penetrant can be removed prior to adding the developing powder.</p>
<h2>Ultrasonic Testing</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform Ultrasonic Testing (UT) on your equipment, its components and welds to ensure it is suitable for continued service. UT is an inspection method that uses a high frequency ultrasound to inspect the steel and find discontinuities that are below the surface. UT can be used to inspect castings, forgings and other steel components.

UT is performed in accordance with SANS, ASME, BS, ISO and various other standards and our personnel are qualified in accordance with ASME.

Advantages of UT are: 

•It can usually be performed while equipment are in service. (no shut down of your plant) Single-sided access is required

•It can detect subsurface discontinuities

•The depth of penetration is superior to other NDT methods 

•Shape, size and position of the discontinuities can be determined and plotted very accurately

•Preparation for UT inspection is relatively easy

•Instantaneous results possible

•Safe to use compared to radiography

Disadvantages of UT are: 

•The surface must be accessible and in a clean and smooth condition to transmit the ultrasound

•It requires a couplant to transfer the ultrasound into the tested object

•Depending on the shape and orientation of the  part, some discontinuities may be difficult to detect
</p>
<h2>Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement (UTM)</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform Ultrasonic Thickness Measurement (UTM) on your equipment to measure the thickness of the parts and ensure it is suitable for continued service. UTM is an inspection method that uses a high frequency ultrasound to measure the thickness of materials. It sends a compression wave of ultrasound through the material and receives the reflection of the wave from the opposite surface. The time it took to for the wave to propagate through the material indicates the thickness of the material. UTM is an effective method to find internal corrosion and erosion of components in your plant. 

UTM is performed in accordance with SANS, ASME, BS, ISO and various other standards and our personnel are qualified in accordance with ASME.</p>

        <h2>Tank Inspection</h2>
        <p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform Tank Inspections on your aboveground storage tanks and its components to ensure it is suitable for continued service. Tank inspections comprise a list of inspection checks and tests that are performed to establish the integrity of a tank.</p>
          <h2>API 653 Inspection</h2>
          <p>The inspections consists of a visual inspection of the tank itself and all its components. It could also include the review of all other related inspections and tests and the API 653 inspector will determine whether the condition of the tank is suitable for continued service.</p>
          <h2>MFL bottom scanning</h2>
          <p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will sub-contract the MFL inspection service using a capable inspection vendor company and NIS will manage the inspection on behalf of the client to ensure the result obtained is adequate and can be used to determine the integrity of the Tank Bottom
</p>
<h2>
Settlement survey</h2>
<p>
NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will sub-contract the Settlement Survey using a capable inspection vendor company and NIS will manage the inspection on behalf of the client to ensure the result obtained is adequate and can be used to determine the integrity of the Tank related to settlement.</p>
<h2>Cathodic Protection Survey</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform the measurements of Cathodic Protection of the tank bottom to ensure that there is suitable protection on the tank bottom to prevent corrosion.
</p>
<h2>Thickness measurements of tank components</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform thickness measurements on the shell and roof of your aboveground storage tanks and its components to ensure it is suitable for continued service.</p>
<h2>Vacuum box testing</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform vacuum box testing on the tank bottom welds to determine if there are any pinhole leaks.</p>
<h2>Annular weld inspection</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will perform magnetic particle inspection on the annular weld between the tank shell and tank bottom plates / annular plates to ensure there are no cracking or other defects present that may cause failure.
</p>
<h2>Hydrostatic testing</h2>
<p>NDT and Inspection Solutions (NIS) will advise and witness the hydrostatic testing of your aboveground storage tanks and its components to ensure it is suitable for continued service.

        <h2>Right of Way inspection (ROW)</h2>
        <p>ROW inspection consists of a visual inspection of the line and surrounding environment and includes a patrol of the line to find threats or damage to the line. The condition of the terrain is recorded  to provide a clear picture of the right of way in which the line operates.</p>
        <h2>Cathodic Protection Measurements (CP)</h2>
        <p>CP measurements are taken on buried lines to ensure it is adequately protected by the impressed current system employed or the sacrificial anodes that are attached to the line. The CP readings are recorded in a log sheet and graphs created to analyze the results.</p>
        <h2>Ultrasonic Thickness Measurements (UTM)</h2>
        <p>UTM are performed on accessible areas of the line to determine the current thickness. Over a period of time a corrosion rate can be established and the remaining life of the line can be determined.</p>
